TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Diagnose_Module/i_FC1001_RMII/n1382/n561/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) ETH_MDIO direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (ETH_MDIO) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance RiscCanFd_CPU/cfd_unit/canfdctrl/rx_buffer_inst/rx_buffer_ram_inst/rx_buf_RAM_inst/ram_memory_reg_0, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance RiscCanFd_CPU/cfd_unit/canfdctrl/rx_buffer_inst/rx_buffer_ram_inst/rx_buf_RAM_inst/ram_memory_reg_1, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance RiscCanFd_CPU/cfd_unit/canfdctrl/txt_buf_comp_gen[0].txt_buffer_inst/txt_buffer_ram_inst/txt_buf_ram_inst/ram_memory_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a RAM block might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance RiscCanFd_CPU/cfd_unit/canfdctrl/txt_buf_comp_gen[1].txt_buffer_inst/txt_buffer_ram_inst/txt_buf_ram_inst/ram_memory_reg, implemented as a RAM block, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block.
